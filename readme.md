# 🏈 Project: *“The I in Team” – NFL Top Offensive Players & Team Success*

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes whether having elite offensive players directly impacts team success in the NFL.  
Common sense suggests that a top QB contributes more to wins than a top TE — but does the data agree?  
Using Python for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, I ranked players across multiple positions and compared their performance to playoff outcomes.

## 📂 Data Preparation & Cleaning
- **Positions studied**: QB, RB, WR, TE  
- **Top players per season**: Top 3 in each position  
- **Timeframe**: Last 13 NFL seasons (~2012–2024)  
- **Metrics for ranking**:
  - Total touchdowns (rushing + receiving)  
  - Yards (Passing for QBs, Rushing for RBs, Receiving for WRs/TEs)  
  - Fantasy points (standard scoring)  

### Data Sources
- Kaggle datasets:  
  - [NFL Stats 2012–2024](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
  - [1926–2024 NFL Scores](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## 📊 Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas)** – preprocessing & ranking top players  
- **Tableau** – interactive dashboards for playoff outcomes vs. player stats  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – workflow documentation (`01_overview`, `02_eda`)

## 🚀 Key Deliverables
- Tableau dashboards (QB, RB, WR, TE, and summary)  
- KPIs:  
  - Relationship between top players and playoff appearances  
  - Position-level impact on playoff likelihood  
  - End-to-end project workflow demonstrating: data prep, KPI design, and dashboard building

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add machine learning models to predict playoff outcomes
