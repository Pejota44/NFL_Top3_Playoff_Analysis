# 🏈 Project: *“The I in Team” – NFL Top Offensive Players & Team Success*

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the top offensive NFL players (QB, RB, WR, TE) from the last 13 seasons (2012–2024) and explores how their performance correlates with team success.

## 📂 Data Preparation & Cleaning
- **Positions studied**: QB, RB, WR, TE  
- **Top players per season**: Top 3 in each position  
- **Timeframe**: Last 13 NFL seasons (~2012–2024)  
- **Metrics for ranking**:
  - Total touchdowns (rushing + receiving)  
  - Yards (Passing for QBs, Rushing for RBs, Receiving for WRs/TEs)
